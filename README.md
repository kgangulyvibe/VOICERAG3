# VoiceRAG: An Application Pattern for RAG + Voice Using Azure AI Search and the GPT-4o Realtime API for Audio

This repo contains an example of how to implement RAG support in applications that use voice as their user interface, powered by the GPT-4o realtime API for audio along with Azure AI search for RAG. This code is customized form of Azure-Samples(https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aisearch-openai-rag-audio)

## Features

* **Voice interface**: The app uses the browser's microphone to capture voice input, and sends it to the backend where it is processed by the Azure OpenAI GPT-4o Realtime API.
* **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: The app uses the Azure AI Search service to answer questions about a knowledge base, and sends the retrieved documents to the GPT-4o Realtime API to generate a response.
* **Audio output**: The app plays the response from the GPT-4o Realtime API as audio, using the browser's audio capabilities.
* **Citations**: The app shows the search results that were used to generate the response.

### Architecture Diagram

The `RTClient` in the frontend receives the audio input, sends that to the Python backend which uses an `RTMiddleTier` object to interface with the Azure OpenAI real-time API, and includes a tool for searching Azure AI Search.

## Getting Started

### Local environment

1. Install the required tools:
   * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   * [Python >=3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
      * **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
      * **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.
   * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   * [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) - For Windows users only.

2. Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aisearch-openai-rag-audio`)
3. Proceed to the next section.

## Deploying the Azure Resources

Follow the steps provided in the attched video for deploying Azure Resources.

1. Create Azure OpenAI service in US East 2 region (or Sweden Central).

2. Deploy Realtime and Embedding models (in US East 2 or Sweden Central).

3. Create Azure Storage account and upload files in the container

4. Create Azure AI Search Service in US East 2 (because semantic search is enabled in US East 2).

5. Import and Vectorize data using Azure AI Search service and Storage account.

## Local APP Deployment

1. Create a file .env in the `app/backend` and update the contents:

   ```shell
      AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=XXXXXX
      AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o-realtime-preview
      AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXX
      AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_VOICE_CHOICE=<choose one: echo, alloy, shimmer>
      AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=XXXX
      AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX=XXXX
      AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY=XXXX
      AZURE_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_CONFIGURATION=XXXX
      AZURE_SEARCH_IDENTIFIER_FIELD=chunk_id
      AZURE_SEARCH_TITLE_FIELD=title
      AZURE_SEARCH_CONTENT_FIELD=chunk
      AZURE_SEARCH_EMBEDDING_FIELD=text_vector
      AZURE_SEARCH_USE_VECTOR_QUERY=true
      AZURE_TENANT_ID=XXXX
   ```

2. Run this command to start the app:

   Windows:

   ```pwsh
   pwsh .\scripts\start.ps1
   ```

   Linux/Mac:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/start.sh
   ```

4. The app is available on [http://localhost:8765](http://localhost:8765).
